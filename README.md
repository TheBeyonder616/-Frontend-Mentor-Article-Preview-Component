## My Process

I approached this project by focusing on creating a responsive article preview component with interactive elements and modern web design techniques.

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties for theming
- Flexbox for layout management
- Responsive design using `clamp()` and viewport-relative units (vw)
- Google Fonts - "Manrope" for typography
- JavaScript for interactive elements

### What I Learned

This project reinforced my knowledge in:

- **Responsive Design:** Using `clamp()` for fluid font sizes and spacing.
- **CSS Variables:** Implementing custom properties for a consistent design system.
- **JavaScript Interactivity:** Managing state and event listeners for dynamic UI changes.
- **Accessibility:** Ensuring that interactive elements are keyboard-accessible and visible.

### Continued Development

Future projects will focus on:

- **Advanced CSS Layouts:** Utilizing CSS Grid for complex layouts.
- **JavaScript Enhancements:** Adding more interactive features and improving UX.
- **Accessibility & SEO:** Enhancing practices for better inclusivity and search engine optimization.
